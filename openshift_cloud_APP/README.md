OpenShift is Red Hat's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that allows developers to quickly develop, host, and scale applications in a cloud environment.

When you first request http://mp1adeebahmed.rhcloud.com/index.html, Openshift will fire up a WildFly application server running in the cloud. You will get a connection error.

Wait about 15-30 seconds for Openshift to deploy the website to the application server, and you'll see that the site is up and running. Pretty neat stuff.

The website is ugly, I threw it together for the purpose of the assignment, added bootstrap and jquery slideshow for extra credit.

My personal site is at http://adeebahmed.com (not on the cloud)

This project is referred to as MP1 in my research paper;
